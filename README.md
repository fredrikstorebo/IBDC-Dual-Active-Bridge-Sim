# IBDC-Dual-Active-Bridge-Sim
Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter with Dual Active Bridge Topology Simulation

This isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter simulation designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK, utilizes a dual active bridge topology.
For controlling the bidirectional power flow, single phase shift modulation is applied.

The simulation model is controlled from the user interface subsystem.
